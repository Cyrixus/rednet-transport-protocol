Rednet Transfer Protocol
Matthew DiBernardo [04.10.2012]

An (approximate) implementation of the HTTP/1.1 standard for use with
ComputerCraft. The purpose of the RTP protocol is to facillitate the creation
and usage of vast wireless Rednet networks by allowing stateless comminucation
between arbitrary clients of such a network.

Note that, while RTP is based heavily on the HTTP/1.1 standard, no explicit
guarantee of compliance is made. Rather HTTP is used as a model for RTP's
behaviors and data structures, in a general sense. RTP's complexity is far
lower than that of HTTP (and its developer resources far more limited), thus
many advanced features should be expected to be missing.

RTP is, however, open source, and free to be modified. The source is available
on GitHub [<insert GitHub address here>], and anyone with the time and
inclination is encouraged to fork it and make their own upgrades. If you make
something cool, tell me about it!

Some basic usage:

RTP is designed to work over Rednet, so every device in the network should be
equipped with a Rednet modem. The side doesn't matter, because the RtpClient/RtpHost
will auto-detect the periphial. In order to create a network, you must have a DHCP
server and a DNS Host. First boot the DHCP server with the -gtlp option (Specifying
that it is a Global Top-Level Provisioner). Then, start up the DNS with the -gtld
(Global Top-Level Domain) The DNS server will auto-detect the GTLP-DHCP server,
register itself as a GTLD and start waiting for requests.

Client devices should then be auto-provisioned with RP Addresses when they connect
for the first time. See the dns-host file for details on registering domains.
