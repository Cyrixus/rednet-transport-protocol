Rednet Transfer Protocol
Matthew DiBernardo [04.10.2012]

An (approximate) implementation of the HTTP/1.1 standard for use with
ComputerCraft. The purpose of the RTP protocol is to facillitate the creation
and usage of vast wireless Rednet networks by allowing stateless comminucation
between arbitrary clients of such a network.

Note that, while RTP is based heavily on the HTTP/1.1 standard, no explicit
guarantee of compliance is made. Rather HTTP is used as a model for RTP's
behaviors and data structures, in a general sense. RTP's complexity is far
lower than that of HTTP (and its developer resources far more limited), thus
many advanced features should be expected to be missing.

RTP is, however, open source, and free to be modified. The source is available
on GitHub [https://github.com/Cyrixus/rednet-transport-protocol], and anyone with the time and
inclination is encouraged to fork it and make their own upgrades. If you make
something cool, tell me about it!
